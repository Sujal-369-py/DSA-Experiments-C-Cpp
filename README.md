# C/C++ Experiments & Data Structures

This repository contains all my **C and C++ experiments**, focusing mainly on **data structures**. It’s a mix of:

- **Polished projects** – well-structured, optimized, and complete.  
- **Rough experiments** – messy, exploratory code capturing my learning process.  

## What’s Inside

- **Arrays & Strings** – searching, sorting, and manipulation.  
- **Linked Lists** – single, doubly, circular.  
- **Stacks & Queues** – array and linked-list based.  
- **Trees** – binary trees, BSTs, traversals.  
- **Graphs** – representation, DFS, BFS.  
- **Hashing** – simple hashing, quadratic probing, resizing.  
- **Miscellaneous** – other mini experiments and C/C++ projects.  

## Structure

- `polished/` – clean and fully functional code.  
- `rough/` – experimental or learning-phase code.  

> This repository is a **journey of learning**, showcasing both mastery and experimentation in C/C++ and data structures.
